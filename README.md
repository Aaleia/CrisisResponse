# CrisisResponse

We're Hunter College Computer Science students working on a data science project together through CUNY Tech Prep 2024.

In this team: Tedd Lee, Aaleia Fernando

# The Spiel
## Analyzing EMS Computer Aided Dispatch System Data from the FDNY :phone::rotating_light:
* 

### Why? 
* 

### Team member responsibilities:
* Tedd:
  * Data organization, visualization, and analysis.
* Aaleia:
  * Data preprocessing
  * Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
  * Frontend build (TBD)
  * Outlines & insights

### The Data
* [Dispatch calls](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj/about_data)

### Video tutorials we think would help:
* [How to Build a Data Pipeline](https://youtu.be/hKv70zftW-Y?si=CpZzFRkK_2CEemNN) (Tedd)
* [End To End Machine Learning | Classification & Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocse1X_rtSI) (Aaleia)

## MVP
The minimum viable product for this would be a model prediction, frontend app, visualizations of data/insights.

## Schedule/Task Outline:
### Data cleaning and preprocessing
* [ ] Hunt down datasets that are directly related to our project ideas
* [ ] Find additional datasets that might be useful or add useful insights to our analysis
* [ ] Get familiar with how the raw data might break things.

### Data analysis
* [ ] Initial glances at trends and outliers
* [ ] Data visualization

### Feature selection
* [ ] Identify features to be used in training our model
### Model building
### Model evaluation
### Presenting our findings

# Weekly Updates:
### OCT 30
* [ ] outline the rest of the project MVP, weekly goals, project direction
* [ ] analyze data and create visualizations
* [ ] group classifications
* [ ] build initial model

### OCT 9-15

* [x] Download the data (GW)
* [x] Look at data (all)
* [x] Do some visualization or find out what's messy about it (AF)
* [ ] + bonus ideation
* [x] MVP (GW)
